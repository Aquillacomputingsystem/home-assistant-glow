## Home Assistant Glow ðŸŒŸ

During my internship at [Nabu Casa][nc] in the first half of 2021, I focused on energy management in your house and how you can collect all energy data and display it in a dashboard.

Home Assistant Glow makes it possible to read a (not so) smart meter that is not equipped with a P1 port, using the pulse LED that is always present in most cases.  In this repository you will find all the information you need to get started yourself.
